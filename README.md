Ridiculous Factorial Calculator
# 🤯 The Ridiculous Factorial Calculator  
### Because normal math is **too predictable**  

Welcome to **The Ridiculous Factorial Calculator**, where mathematical sanity is **optional** and factorials defy logic! 🔥  

## 🎩 What is this madness?  
Ever wondered what would happen if factorials **ignored conventional rules** and **embraced total chaos**? Well, wonder no more. This calculator offers:  
✅ **Standard Factorials (`n!`)** – For those who still believe in traditional math.  
✅ **Chaos Mode** – Where exponentiation, recursion, and randomness conspire against reason.  
✅ **Gamma Ray Gun Mode** – Because **why should integers get all the factorial fun?**  

## 🎮 How to Use  
1️⃣ Enter a number to factorialize (or *obliterate*).  
2️⃣ Select your mode:  
   - `0` = **Normal Factorial** (boring, logical, still acceptable)  
   - `1` = **Chaos Mode** (who needs order anyway?)  
   - `2` = **Gamma Ray Gun Mode** (beware of excessive absurdity)  
3️⃣ Behold the result—and pray it doesn’t exceed the known universe.  

## ⚠️ Warning  
- If your result surpasses **1E100**, reality might break. 🚀  
- Do **not** use this calculator to balance your finances. 💰  
- Attempts to explain results **may cause existential crises.** 🤯  

## 🚀 Why?  
Because factorials should be **fun**, ridiculous, and **philosophically questionable**.  
This calculator **challenges the boundaries of math** with humor, chaos, and *just enough logic to pretend it makes sense.*  

## 💡 Credits  
Created by **Aaron**, a fearless explorer of unconventional math, philosophical chaos, and programming absurdity.  
Rescued from BASIC’s quirks and **brought to life with the power of ridiculousness!** 😆

Now your **README.md is as ridiculous as the calculator itself!** 🚀🔥  
Want to add any *extra* absurdity before launching it into the world? 😂
