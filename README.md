🧮 Ridiculous Factorial Calculator (RFO BASIC Edition)
Created by Aaron Ingebrigtsen
🚀 In collaboration with MS Copilot

What Is This?
Welcome to the most absurd, over-the-top factorial calculator ever devised! If regular factorials weren’t chaotic enough, this tool takes things to ridiculous depths—literally!

Why Use This?
Need factorials with extra silliness? ✅

Want to break math so hard even NASA calls you? ✅

Curious what happens when a Gamma Ray Gun fires at a pie? ✅✅✅

How It Works
1️⃣ Enter a positive whole number (N), because negative factorials don’t belong in this dimension. 2️⃣ Choose a factorial depth (! count)—the deeper you go, the weirder reality gets. 3️⃣ Watch mathematics unfold in ways nature never intended.

Key Features
✅ Supports deep factorial calculations (within reason and sanity). ✅ Injects humor into math because why not? ✅ Easter eggs lurking throughout—because programs should be fun! ✅ Traps invalid input so users can't break math too hard.

Hidden Secrets
✨ Birthday Easter Egg: Input 27!! with a depth of 10, and you'll unlock a special birthday message for Aaron himself! 🥧 Gamma Ray Gun vs. Pie: Answer the secret pie challenge, and… well, expect a rabbit to chase you away! 🐰

How to Run It
1️⃣ Open RFO BASIC 2️⃣ Copy-paste the program into RFO BASIC 3️⃣ Run it. Watch reality bend.
